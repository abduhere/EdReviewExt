# Educative Reviewer Extension

This is a Chrome extension that helps in reviewing content automatically. Based on a set of rules, it checks the content in the lesson for inconsistencies and displays errors. It can also check for missing full stops and commas. The extension highlights potential issues such as template inconsistencies, missing sections in the lesson, and broken images, making it easier for reviewers to identify and correct them.

This extension can be cloned to your personal machine and tweaked according to the use case of any person.
